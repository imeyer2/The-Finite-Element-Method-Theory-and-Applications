# The Finite Element Method 

[The Finite Element Method *Theory, Implementation, and Applications*](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-642-33287-6) (ISBN: 978-3642332869) provides a wealth of knowledge in FEM and provides many algorithms essential to application of these methods.

This repository contains Python code that implements many of the routines outlined in the book. This repository is a translation of the MATLAB code provided in the text.


*   `final_project_original.py`
    This is the script for Figure 1 in the Final Paper. Contains a Python version of `initmesh` from MATLAB.
*   `zero_initial_boundary_ten.py`
    This is the script for Figure 2 in the Final Paper



## Directory Structure


*   `chapterX`
